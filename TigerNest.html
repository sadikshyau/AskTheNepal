<h2>The Legend of Tiger's Nest</h2>
<p>
In the 8th century, Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava), the Indian Buddhist master who brought Buddhism to Bhutan, flew from Tibet on the back of a tigress (his consort Yeshe Tsogyal transformed into a tigress). He landed on the cliff and meditated in a cave for three years, three months, three weeks, three days, and three hours, subduing demons and spreading Buddhism. The monastery was later built around this sacred cave in 1692. Though badly damaged by fire in 1998, it has been meticulously restored to its former glory.
